handle the OS's repeated keypresses for local events (globals dont repeat)

option to only shuffle/loop through filtered song list (may not be easy, will need to wait for song to change normally and then switch the song again to the next song in the filtered list, or to a random one from that list if shuffle is on. maybe find a way to handle it from VLC?)

reconnect after timeout and continue update loop

*** add a heartbeat for the update loop to recognize when something went wrong so it can be restarted

table is not showing selection border until i click one of the items, no matter what. figure it out cause it's annoying

sort FilePreferences alphabetically... this would require changing the interal Properties object
	in FilePreferences which is used to read/write to file

*** upgrade to file list:
	download the youtube data and parse for date modified for each
	set date modified to upload date
	use luafilesystem fs.attributes to get mtime
	
	decide how to handle this second sorting option...
		actually use table headers and multiple columns?
		don't bother showing the date and add a combobox of sort options?
