global keyboard shortcuts
    menu to change local and global keyboard shortcuts, just like VLC
    disable repeated hotkey presses when holding down key

save user settings to a file in appdata
    create a menubar button to browse to the folder containing that file (explorer.exe /select,/path/to/file)

option to set default modes (playing/paused, looping/repeating/neither, shuffling, and maybe volume) to be set on load
option to favorite a particular song

option to only shuffle/loop through filtered song list (may not be easy, will need to wait for song to change normally and then switch the song again to the next song in the filtered list, or to a random one from that list if shuffle is on. maybe find a way to handle it from VLC?)

maybe generate a list of songs using a different language and have VLC load the list form a text file? as long as the web interface allows editing items in the playlist, this would allow for ^^ to work

EQ editor? does EQ even work over the stream, or can it be done locally?

button to toggle table view / list view for playlist

TODO instant pause waits until the end of the buffer, have the playback loop break if playingStream is false on top of looping while it is true

TODO use java.util.Properties to save user data
have a map of properties keys and their defaults
store the host and ports in the properties but require password entering every time (different initial top pane or a popup for password)

***
switch to using VLC's media library function, where multiple folders can be added and swapped between. need to rewrite playlist parser to account for this, as well as keep track of each different playlist/folder using a list or map
