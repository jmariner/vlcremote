handle the OS's repeated keypresses for local events (globals dont repeat)

option to only shuffle/loop through filtered song list (may not be easy, will need to wait for song to change normally and then switch the song again to the next song in the filtered list, or to a random one from that list if shuffle is on. maybe find a way to handle it from VLC?)

table: wait for a way to get song metadata through vlc; only things we have currently are title, artist, and duration. album is containing folder which is a bit hacky)

switch to using VLC's media library function, where multiple folders can be added and swapped between. need to rewrite playlist parser to account for this, as well as keep track of each different playlist/folder using a list or map

reconnect after timeout and continue update loop

***
create custom/status.json just like custom/playlist.json
add vlc.var.get(vlc.object.aout(), "equalizer-preset") to the status table in httprequests2.lua

***
switch icons to SVG as long as their color can be changed
