handle the OS's repeated keypresses for local events (globals dont repeat)

option to only shuffle/loop through filtered song list (may not be easy, will need to wait for song to change normally and then switch the song again to the next song in the filtered list, or to a random one from that list if shuffle is on. maybe find a way to handle it from VLC?)

table: wait for a way to get song metadata through vlc; only things we have currently are title, artist, and duration. album is containing folder which is a bit hacky)

reconnect after timeout and continue update loop

*** add a heartbeat for the update loop to recognize when something went wrong so it can be restarted

table is not showing selection border until i click one of the items, no matter what. figure it out cause it's annoying

*** upgrade to file list:
	download list of songs - these files have their "date modified" set to the upload date
	parse the dates modified and save to master file
	set metadata (title, artist, etc), changing date modified
	use "touch -d date" to reset the date modified to the upload date
	use VLC's SDs or something to get that date into VLC's playlist.json
